The R script follows the information asked in the project and the R script has extensive and self explanatory comments. Hopefully that would work. 

The output from run_analysis is a text file but I have uploaded a pdf file to the submission website for two reasons

1) Since the grading would be on the tidy data, it would be much less time consuming for the evaluator to look at the output in pdf than in text.
2) Since I am quite new to github, I am not sure the code would be able to extract data from my working directory remotely. But the code I have in run_analysis would be self explanatory and hopefully it would be able to recreate the text file for those who are so inclined.
